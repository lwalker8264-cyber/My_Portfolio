Bellabeat Data Analysis: Smart Device Trends
A Case Study in Data-Driven Marketing Strategy
📌 Project Overview
As part of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team, I analyzed smart device data from the FitBit Fitness Tracker (via the Bella Beats survey) to identify consumer habits. This project focuses on translating raw activity, sleep, and health data into actionable business insights for Bellabeat’s product growth.

SQL: Primary tool for data cleaning and transformation. I performed table joins (e.g., Activity + Sleep data), filtered for quality, and aggregated metrics.

R (RStudio): Used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.

Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, skimr.

Kaggle: Project environment and data hosting.

# My_Portfolio
# This portfolio is to show case my accomplishments and growth in my coding career through projects.

# Just a couple things about me. I began my coding journey about 2 years ago through taking interest in SQL and R, after which I began and finished a 
# Google data analytics certificate course which was an amazing experience. During that time I became more and more infatuated with coding, the rewarding dance of idea, confusion, solution, then progress. So after finishing my certificate I began my job search and found out that a certificate is not quite enough and that I need a portfolio as well.

# So here I am creating a portfolio to show how my skills reflect as real world project.
# So umm I forgot to actually say a few things about my self lol I enjoy hiking, fishing, coding, hanging out with my wife, and taking care of my animals ("Willith, Chonkers, Winston").
# I also ran my own foodtruck for a year ("Protein Paradise") which was an awesome experience and I hope to get back to be able to run it part time when I'm a bit more further along in my tech career.
# I also quite enjoy gaming and will be making some basic gaming projects to show case my journey through Python.
